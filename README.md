EEG signal processing for Autism spectrum disorder detection

Introduction:
The constant activity of the brain that is measured by the electrodes is called the electroencephalogram or EEG. The electrodes record the electrical activity of your brain.The electrodes of an EEG headset can’t detect changes in single neurons, but instead detect the electrical changes of thousands of neurons signalling at the same time. The signal from the electrodes is then sent to an amplifier that amplifies the signal. A computer then receives this signal, and can generate various maps of brain activity, with a rapid temporal resolution.

Dataset Details:
EEG dataset from the King Abdulaziz University (KAU), Saudi Arabia is used in this study to verify the proposed methods. The dataset used in this project is not openly available. This dataset was recorded from four normal subjects (males, aged 9–16 years) and 13 autistic subjects (male and female, aged 10–16 years). 
The dataset was recorded in a relaxed state with 16-channel EEG at a sampling rate of 256 Hz.
The EEG data is presented in .dat files.
